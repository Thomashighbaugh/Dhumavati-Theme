# Dhumavati GTK Theme 
![Dhumavati GTK screnshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thomashighbaugh/Dhumavati-Theme/master/screenshot.png)

### Note: 
This GTK theme is meant to be utilized as part of my Awesome Window Manager configuration. If you use it with another window manager or desktop environment, your mileage will vary. 
- The window decorations are provided within the Awesome WM configuration as well. If used in other environments, it will default to the window decorations from the source project: Canvas GTK theme.
